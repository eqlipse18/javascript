      // slice (start, end) means cut the array
      //  ---> start is start of the index of the array whereas //
      // ------------>end  is basically the index of arrays if the index is 3 then include upto index 3 but not index 3

      var a = ["babau", "alex", "tony", "rahaul"];
      document.write(a + "<br>");
      var b = a.slice(1, 4); // this will cut the array from the index 1 to index 3 not included the index 4
      // if a.slice(2) ---> starting from index 2 to ending
      // if a.slice(-2) ---> this will count the array from the last as reverse indexing heer index[-1]=rahaul to till end in reverse order

      //splice fn ---> inserts new elements in the same existing array  with new indexes it  doesnot create new arrays
      // syntxa ---> splice (index,howmany,"new value")
      // index --> from which index inserting of new elemenst shoould start
      //how many -->basically deletes the index if we dont want to delete if dont want to dlt it we can pass 0 there so the element will pushed to next index
      // new value ---> new element values to  insert the array  // herer a exmample --->
      var b = ["sony", "alex", "tony", "rahaul"];
      b.splice(2, 0, "me", "you"); // here
      // 2---> two new value added
      // 0 ---> no values deleted after new elements if it was 1 the one elment dlted after new elemenst and if 2 = two elements dlted after new elemnts see the output [alex,tony,rahaulsony,alex,me,you ] old 2 elements deleeted due to new values
      // -2, -1 ---> we can even pass neg index as reverse indexing
      // if you want to just dlt  vlaues but not to add new values the pass splice as  b.splice(2,2); two values deleted
